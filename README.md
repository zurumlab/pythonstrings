In computer programming, a string is a sequence of characters. For example, "hello" is a string containing a sequence of characters 'h', 'e', 'l', 'l', and 'o'.

Python strings are "immutable" which means they cannot be changed after they are created.

Strings are amongst the most popular types in Python. We can create them simply by enclosing characters in quotes. Python treats single quotes like "hello"

This project will focus on how strings can be manupulated to achieve a desired result. Welcome to my repo. I'm James Chizurum.
